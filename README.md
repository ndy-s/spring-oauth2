# Spring OAuth2

This is a small personal project where I'm experimenting with Spring Boot and GitHub OAuth2 login.
I wanted a simple, clean setup to understand how OAuth2 works in a real-world Java web app.

The main goal was to create a solid starting point I can reuse whenever I need authentication in future projects.
